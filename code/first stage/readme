First, we use the procedure (in folder : construct by ...) to construct candidate cubes.
Second, we use the precedure (in folder : degree evaluation ...) to evaluate the degree of candidate cubes.
Third, we select the intermediate cube according to the strategy of Algorithm 6 in paper, which is very easy to completed.
