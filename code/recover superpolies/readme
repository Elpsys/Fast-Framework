1. We need to install Gurobi and configure the required environment variables.
2. Select the Round in "main.cpp". The cube can be set in "cube.txt" and the form is "0,1,2,3,....,n" (the index begins with 0).
3. Type ./exec.sh to generate the executable program "trivium". At the same time, three folders will be created in the current directory,
   namely "STATE", "LOG" and "TERM". "LOG" contains log files; "STATE" saves some important data so that the program can continue to run after 
   a crash; "TERM" stores the results produced by the execution of the program.
4. Type ./trivium to run the program. While the program is running, you can check the status of the program by viewing the files in the LOG.
